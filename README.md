# Make Real: AI-Powered Wireframe to HTML Converter

Make Real is an innovative tool that transforms hand-drawn wireframes into functional HTML prototypes using AI technology. This project is based on [tldraw](https://www.tldraw.com/) and integrates with OpenRouter's AI models to provide a seamless design-to-code experience.

## Purpose

The main purpose of Make Real is to bridge the gap between conceptual design and functional prototypes. It aims to accelerate the web development process by allowing designers and developers to quickly visualize and iterate on their ideas.

## Key Features

- Infinite canvas for drawing wireframes
- AI-powered conversion of drawings to interactive HTML prototypes
- Real-time preview of generated prototypes
- Custom prompt support for fine-tuning AI output
- Responsive design generation
- Annotation and iteration capabilities
- Integration with OpenRouter AI models
- Built with Next.js for optimal performance

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/make-real.git
   cd make-real
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up your OpenRouter API key in a `.env.local` file:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

5. Draw your wireframe on the canvas.

6. Click the "Make Real" button to generate the HTML prototype.

7. Iterate on the design by annotating the result and regenerating as needed.

## Use Cases

1. Rapid Prototyping: Quickly convert design ideas into functional prototypes.
2. Design Exploration: Easily experiment with different layout and design concepts.
3. Client Presentations: Generate interactive demos for client pitches and feedback sessions.
4. Design Education: Teach UI/UX concepts by demonstrating the design-to-code process.
5. Collaborative Design: Use in team brainstorming sessions to visualize ideas in real-time.
6. Design System Development: Rapidly prototype and test components for design systems.
7. Accessibility Testing: Generate HTML to evaluate and improve design accessibility.
8. Responsive Design Testing: Create and test responsive layouts quickly.

## Proposed Improvements

1. Multi-page support for creating more complex prototypes
2. Integration with popular design tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch)
3. Version control and design history tracking
4. AI-powered design suggestions and improvements
5. Export options for different frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
6. Collaborative real-time editing features
7. Advanced customization options for AI-generated code
8. Integration with design systems and component libraries
9. Performance optimization for large and complex designs
10. Enhanced accessibility features in generated prototypes
